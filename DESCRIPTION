Description: This Package utilizes a Semi-parametric Differential 
     Abundance/expression analysis (SDA) method for metabolomics and proteomics 
     data from mass spectrometry as well as single-cell RNA sequencing data. SDA 
     is able to robustly handle non-normally distributed data and provides a clear 
     quantification of the effect size.
